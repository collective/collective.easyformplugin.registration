Collective Easyform: Registration plugin
========================================

Plugin for collective.easyform that allows to manage a subscription form.

You can set the max number of attendees, a waiting list and open and close dates.

Subscription logic
------------------

Users can subscribe to the form if:

- Current date is between open and close date
- There are still available slots
- Available slots are full but there is a waiting list

Contact registrants

You can send messages to registrants (and waiting list) to keep them updated.
